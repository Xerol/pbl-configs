# PBL Comp Server Configs
Configurations for [Pro Battle League](http://battleleague.com) servers (and [Arena: Respawn](https://github.com/Xerol/arena-respawn) servers, more generally).

These configs are intended to quickly switch a server between public mode and tournament mode, including setting a server password, changing the server title, and switching certain SourceMod plugins on and off.

The primary configurations for public and tournament mode in A:R are already included with the A:R distribution under `/config/sourcemod/respawn.\*.cfg` (where \* =  `public`, `pretournament`, or `tournament`), and most configurations for these modes are done in those files. The configs included here are solely for additional, non-gameplay-specific configurations.
